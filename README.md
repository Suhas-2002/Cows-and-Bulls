## Cows and Bulls Game

The "Cows and Bulls" game is a classic code-breaking game where the player tries to guess a secret 3-digit number. The game provides feedback on each guess, indicating the number of "cows" and "bulls" in the guess.

- A "cow" represents a correct digit in the wrong position.
- A "bull" represents a correct digit in the correct position.

The player has 10 attempts to guess the secret number correctly. After each guess, the game displays the number of cows and bulls, helping the player to refine their next guess.

The game features a responsive web interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes an input field for the player to enter their guess, buttons to submit the guess and start a new game, and a results table to track the previous guesses and their corresponding cows and bulls counts.

Have fun playing the "Cows and Bulls" game and see how quickly you can crack the code!
